## Motivation

I had a 10GB file DB backup for [https://rappad.co](RapPad) that I needed to split up so I can reload it on my new laptop.
I tried using some other apps but I couldn't figure out how to use it or they were too complicated for my use case.
This is a simple Ruby script that worked.

## Usage

```
ruby run.rb <filename>
```

Files will begin populating in ./out folder.
